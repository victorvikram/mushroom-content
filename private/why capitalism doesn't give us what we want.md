*A bias towards ad-supported things*
Price discrimination is great for producers of goods, because it allows them to capture much more of the surplus that the good produces. Let’s say there are one hundred people. The first person is willing to pay one dollar for a good, say, the right to watch TV show online. The hundredth person is willing to pay one hundred dollars to watch that TV show, and the $n\text{th}$ person is willing to pay $n$ dollars. If the seller cannot price discriminate, he must pick a single price that will maximize his revenues, in this case, fifty dollars. The revenue at this price is $50 \times 50 = 2500$, because fifty customers pay fifty dollars. Reducing the price to $49$ here increases the number of customers by one (the forty-ninth person now also buys), but it reduces revenue since everyone else now pays less $51 \times 49 = 2499$. But if the seller can charge each person exactly as much as they are willing to pay (in other words, if the seller can price discriminate) he can sell to everyone, and make much more: $1 + 2 + 3 + … + 100 = \frac{101 \times 100}{2} = 5050$. Much better! Now, in this example it appears that price discrimination increases total surplus, because now many more people . Indeed, in monopolistic situations, price discrimination *does* increase surplus because  

**Ad-supported products**. People don’t usually think of ads as a mechanism of price discrimination, but they are. Here is how it works. It is worth more to show an ad to someone who has a generally higher willingness to pay for things. For instance, if I can show an ad to a wealthy banker, I can conceivably coax her to spend hundreds of dollars on an item. I will not get the same return showing my ad to a minimum wage worker. Thus, if I have many people of many different incomes watching (for instance) my ad-supported TV show, I can extract relatively higher value from the views of higher-earning people, since their eyeballs are worth more to advertisers than those of poor people. This argument isn’t strictly about income, but rather general willingness to pay for things: the people with a higher general willingness to pay (a trait highly correlated with income) are worth more to advertisers, and thus their presence watching my TV show or surfing on my social media pays disproportionately.

Compare this to the situation where I charge everyone a fixed membership fee. Here, no matter one’s willingness to pay, everyone pads my coffers equally. I can no longer draw disproportionate value from those with a higher willingness to pay, and I am back to the dilemma at the start, where
