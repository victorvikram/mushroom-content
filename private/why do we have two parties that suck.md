The question I am dealing with here is the following: does party competition lead to a government that does what people want? Of course, it is a little tricky define "what people want", since people might want different things and it is never quite clear how to aggregate that into the so-called collective will. But here I will focus on fairly uncontroversial notions of the collective will, and I will argue that even on those, political party competition does terribly. In particular, I'll ask the following questions:
1) Does political party competition find consensus when it can be found?
2) Does it lead to government focusing on issues that people care most about?
3) Does it lead to a government that does things when they are broadly popular?

The common picture is that parties compete for votes, and they each have a task of putting together a majority coalition. I believe the commonly-held intuition is that this task of putting together a majority coalition induces political parties to search for a broadly popular platform. Certainly, if they can find consensus positions, they will take them, otherwise, in an effort to attract as many people as possible, they will adopt broadly popular stances on broadly cared about issues. 

But this intuition is not quite right. If there was a single party whose objective was to maximize their appeal (which is rarely the objective in one-party systems), then yes, something like the above might be true. But parties do not simply assemble a coalition in a vacuum; they try to carve out a niche in the interstices of the party coalitions that already exist. And in this setting, the stances that could get them the most votes are often not the ones that are the most broadly supported.

But still, shouldn't it at least be the case that majority parties are picking the stances with the broadest appeal? In this piece I'll argue why not.

I will be using a simple model of voter and party behavior. For each voter, there are several issues where they can take one of two positions, pro- or anti-. They also can care more or less about an issue. There will be some issues where every voter is pro, for instance, economic growth. That is okay. We can visualize a voter as a series of unbalanced barbells, one for each issue, where the size of the bell denotes the issue's importance to a voter. We can do the exact same for political parties, except in this case the size of the barbell is how much a party focuses or emphasizes that issue. We assume that voters vote for the party by calculating the distance on each dimension and averaging, weighting by how much they care about each dimension.

Scenarios to discuss
- the single, obvious, consensus issue
- uncorrelated issues
- inertial parties
- wedge issues
- making compromise seem harder than it is
### Scenario 1: the consensus issue
Let us say that there is one issue on which there is broad consensus (I know it is hard to think of one, and I will come to why that probably is). But suppose everyone is in favor of, say, improving education. Should parties adopt "improving education" as part of their platform? Well, yes, but

### points to make
- we need to realize that in some places, dictators *actually are popular*, because propaganda actually convinces people. are we just like those people, but worse?

### analyses to do
- to what extent is my barbell model different from a space
- can my barbell model represent arbitrary rank-order preferences
### complications to introduce
- what if parties are not acting as single strategic agents, but rather as a marketplace, the way they do now
- what if we used a different voting system: quadratic, plurality, ...?
- what if we made it into a market. what would that even look like?
- what if there are many parties
- how do add the component of affect to this model? maybe it can just be another dimension, but maybe it behaves differently
- difference between mandatory voting and non-mandatory voting. for now i guess ill assume non-mandatory voting
- maybe something that deals with valence issues differently
- maybe i can add something to party strategy which is how they associate issues, how they package them up
