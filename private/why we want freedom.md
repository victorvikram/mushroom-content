In this article I do not settle on a particular definition of freedom, but rather, I take a pluralistic approach. The first section briefly describes this zoo of freedom-concepts, and some ways that we might consider taxonomizing them. The second section then provides a sampling of the benefits we usually associate with freedom, while being careful to specify, when necessary, if only some of the freedom-concepts in the zoo confer that benefit.
## 1. Notions of freedom

## 2. Benefits of freedom

### i. *Pluralism* - if we don't want to commit to a particular conception of the good life, freedom allows people to live according to their own.

### ii. *Optimization* - if you increase your set of choices, the best decision available to you can only improve.
Imagine the world is a decision tree. At every moment, you make a choice, and at the next moment, you get a payoff that depends on the choice you made, along with a new set of choices. One's goal as an agent is to maximize their payoff in their journey through this tree. With this simple worldview, expanding the choice set at any given step can only increase your "best case scenario", because any options that exist in the expanded set existed in the restricted set, but perhaps a better alternative has opened up. This is one simple argument in favor of freedom: if we think of freedom as an expansion of the choice set (you are freer if your choices are a superset of what they were before), then increasing freedom is a surefire way of improving (or at least not worsening) your best-case utility. 

This decision tree model of the world is especially applicable to games: imagine for instance a game of *Catan*, in which, on every turn, you make a decision of what you do, which gets you a certain payoff (the number of victory points you achieve on that turn) and also opens up future possibilities (for instance, building a settlement at a port allows you to trade resources you have for resources you need). Video games, and the reinforcement learning algorithms created to play them, follow a similar logic. I would not be surprised if the collective man hours spent immersed in video games has made this optimization logic more appealing to people. However, it is not completely clear that it makes sense to think of the world as a series of discrete decisions with payoffs (&&[[structuring the moral world]]).

Even if we do accept the premise of this paradigm (life is a decision tree, and adding choices can't reduce your best-case utility), it is not clear that increasing your best-case payoff will make you better off. As any reinforcement learning programmer will know, expanding the choice set (all else equal) also makes the optimization problem more difficult to solve. Imagine you have two choices on every turn (dependent on your previous choices), and you play ten turns. Then you have $2^{10} = 1,024$ pathways whose payoffs you must compare in order to pick the optimal one. Add a single choice at every step and that number goes up to $3^{10} = 59,049$. This is part of the reason that Go was a much more difficult game for AI to beat than chess — there were just so many more possible moves at every step. 
### iii. *Development* - freedom provides the ideal conditions for learning, creativity, and general development.
How do people learn? Perhaps we imagine ourselves as simple reinforcement learners: we try things that seem appealing, see how well they work out for us, and then revise our assessments of what seem appealing. Maybe we are a little more thoughtful, and we design experiments, testing how a given variable (say, eating breakfast) affects our well-being, holding everything else constant. Maybe instead we are more bookish types, and we learn by reading about knowledge that others have developed and communicated (&&[[kinds of learning]]). 

Freedom is necessary for all of these kinds of learning to take place. Even with simple reinforcement learning, we need the freedom to bias our exploration away from decisions that have been unappealing in the past (along with the inverse): if we absolutely hated a job as a tax consultant, we might shy away from trying to work as an accountant. Of course, we can learn *something* about what is appealing or unappealing to us even if we are not the choice-maker, but our learning potential will be severely hampered — we will be over-sampling regions of the space that we already know are unappealing, rather than moving to more promising options. Learning by experimentation requires even more freedom, because changing one thing while holding everything else constant requires even more control over our circumstances than reinforcement learning might. 

Book learning requires freedom on two sides. First, freedom of expression was required for the knowledge to be disseminated. And second, it was was also necessary to allow a learner to gravitate to the material that would be able to answer her questions (one can see that this form of freedom is woefully undervalued in our education system). 

In the heading I listed not only learning, however, but also creativity and development. I did this because they all have something in common, which is that they are "frontier processes". What I mean is that we can't know the best way to do them before we do them. With, this is because we don't yet know the thing we are setting out to learn. With creativity, similarly, we don't know what we are setting out to create. And both of these things are components of development, where we don't quite know what we will become as a result of doing something, and therefore, we don't know if, for that new version of ourselves, the thing we are about to do will have been the right choice. As a result, a formula cannot work; the process must include trial, reinforcement, experimentation, possible failure, and revision of one's worldview. And these sorts of processes require freedom. 

In the preceding paragraph, I use the word *we* a lot, and I am intentionally vague with it. Do I mean "we" in the sense of "we who are all learning and creating and developing *as individuals*", or do I mean "we who are contributing to the learning, creation, and development of *a collective*"? In this context, the answer is that both work. The case is stronger for the collective notion, since in that case, . Still even as individuals, we have lots of private (why does the arg. apply to individuals. first, because it makes us conscious and active learners. second, private experience.)

One might rightly ask, *for whom* is learning (or creativity, or development) a frontier process? For the individual, or for the collective the individual is part of? I argue elsewhere that the usual way of thinking about this dichotomy — with *research* being at the "societal frontier" and *education* being at the "individual frontier" (&&[[levels of development]]) — is at best incomplete. However, 



One can think of learning, creativity, and development on the individual and societal level.

### iv. *Natural rights* - we have a natural right not to be coerced and freedom is necessary to ensure that right.

### v. *Self-concept* - freedom allows us to build up an identity through the choices we make, and to feel good about being authentic to that identity.

### vi. *Spiritual connectedness* - some kinds of freedom involve connecting with a "true self" that transcends 

### vii. *Realization* - freedom allows us to make full use of our decision-making capacities.

### viii. *Demonstrated preference* - freedom is the best proxy for well-being because what people choose is an indication of their preference.

### ix. *Decision* - sometimes well-being comes from having conviction in our current course of action, which freedom can help us develop.

### x. *Complementarity* - it provides a counterweight to majoritarianism, by saying that certain things should not be up to vote.



# Notions of freedom
The funny thing about freedom is that people agree it's a good thing but they don't agree on what it is. There are some concepts like this, where the value of the concept is as fundamental as its definition: happiness, harmony, and equality come to mind. It almost seems with these things that people define them retroactively, in order that they actually be valuable. Hence the agreement on value, but disagreement over meaning. In the case of freedom this has led to a notion 

*part about what the family resemblance is*

- choice
- openness

- authenticity
- endorsement

with widespread agreement that they are a a good thing but widespread disagreement on what they are: 

But how can people agree that freedom is a good thing 
# Utility maximization
There is one class of arguments in favor of freedom that treats freedom as instrumental to utility maximization. The argument takes a few different forms, but the common thread is that they don't make freedom inherently valuable — it is only valuable because it, heuristically speaking, tends to help us maximize our utility. Under this worldview, when it is obvious that freedom does not increase utility, it should be put aside. 
## Arguments for

### Learning
Still, this reasoning is sufficient to convince most that, at least in some range, having more choices is better. Even if you cannot optimize fully, making a choice, seeing its consequences, and then adjusting accordingly is only possible if you have choices. Every choice we make — switching jobs, trying new activities, dating someone — gives us information on what makes us happy that we can then use in our future decisions. 
### Information
Even ignoring the dynamic learning aspect, there are strong reasons to believe that at any given choice point, a particular agent is best suited to make the optimal choice: I likely have more fine-grained information than pretty much anyone else about *both* my local environment *and* my own mental states. Information about my local environment and my own mental states is disproportionately likely to influence the utility payoff of my decision: in a decision about whether to quit my job, I know most about how much money I've saved up, how much I can live on while I'm looking for a new job, my possibilities for future employment, and the difference to my well-being that will result from making a change. So usually, I am best equipped to be making the decision. 
### Impact
While you may be best informed about what will make you better-off, since you've learned from past experiences, and since relevant information for making a decision is often local, there remains one problem. Your actions do not only affect you — they affect others too. And while you maybe best informed about your action's effects *on you*, the same cannot be said for their effects on others. But we tend to make another assumption that tends to justify leaving choices up to individuals: that not only is there locality in the information goes *into* making a choice, there is also locality of impact that comes *out of* making a choice. We tend to believe that, in general, our choices mostly affect us. And this is the necessary piece that completes the utility-based justification for freedom: our choices mostly affect us, and we are best informed about what will make us happy, so people should be left to their own devices when it comes to decision-making. 
### Demonstrated preferences
The previous arguments argue somehow that increasing choice that people have  is probably the best way to let them maximize their well-being. This argument is a bit different: it says that what people decide to do should be our best guess at what maximizes their well-being. Because well-being is such a nebulous concept, we don't really have good ways define it in a way that lends itself to managing a society. Listing out all the things that we think well-being consists in (pleasure, satisfaction, peace, meaning...), and measuring those seems untenable. Asking people how happy they are according to their own definition is vulnerable to all sorts of problems. Perhaps the best thing we can do, from a "social planner" perspective, is to just look at the choices people make and to *define* the choice they make as the one that best maximizes their well-being — that is, to take people's choices as their *demonstrated preferences*. Then the argument for increasing freedom of choice is simple. It is just the optimality principle stated above — more choices cannot be worse for a person, if we assume that the choice people make is the best one for them (and, more subtly, that adding more choices doesn't change the well-being derived from the existing ones). 

Of course, if we accept that the choice people make is the one that maximizes their well-being, it is not a difficult leap to see more freedom is better. The difficult leap is in accepting that choice conception of well-being. One imagines, for instance, a heroin addict making clearly terrible choices. But we should remember, of course, that the heroin addict makes decisions on different timescales. He makes the decision today to shoot up again, which to many might seem ill-advised. But what if he was asked at the beginning of the year, do you want to quit heroin next year? He might say yes. So on *some* timescale, he would decide to give up heroin. It is just that in our lives we don't always have the affordances to make choices on the timescales that would have the best chance at improving our well-being (for the heroin addict, there is scarce machinery that will allow him to *commit* to that choice).

There is another paradigmatic example of the failure of choice in maximizing well-being, this time at the collective level. Imagine everyone can donate a plot of land from their individual yards to make a large shared park. This shared park would be better for everyone then their individual plots of land, because they would be able to go for long walks in the green space, or play sports, or socialize together, things that would not have been possible had they had their own fenced off yards. But the problem is that someone might think "hmm, if I let everyone donate their plot of land, but I keep mine, I can have my own private plot of land, *and* I can benefit from the shared park (which, lacking my own land, would be slightly smaller, but not noticeably)". And if everyone thinks like this, no one will donate their plot of land, and everyone will be worse off for lack of the park. Here is another example of choice not leading to the maximization of collective well being, but we can do a similar trick as we did with the heroin addict. Instead of asking everyone individually if they'll donate their plot, we can ask everyone beforehand if they'll agree to a contract stating that *everyone* donates their plot of land. Knowing that this contract is the only way to get a shared park, which makes everyone better off, everyone would agree.

Both examples 

It is an epistemological argument 

that utility is such a nebulous concept that the only way to determine the things that increase people's utility is to see what choices they make — their demonstrated preferences. There is good reason to think that this is better than any other thing you could do: asking them, scanning their brain, examining 
## Arguments against
### Number of choices is 
### Interactions 
### Freedom plays second fiddle 
Aside from the problem of actually *finding* the optimal, rather than it just existing, there are a number of difficulties with the 
There are other difficulties too. For one thing, states of the world are not all (obviously) comparable. It is of course true, in this world model, that if I have a strict superset of the choices I had previously, my best case scenario can't be any worse. But what if I have more choices, but different ones? If in scenario 1 I can choose between an apple and an orange, and scenario 2 I can choose between an orange, a pear, and a pineapple, am I freer in the second case because I have more choices? Well, in the "freedom as instrumental to utility maximization" perspective, what matters  

And of course, most of the difficulties with freedom start when the choices of one can limit the choices of another, as for example capturing a player's queen in chess does. Once this begins to happen 

# Decision-based notion of happiness
This one may seem similar to the utility maximization point, but it is a bit different. The idea is that there *is no* scalar quantity like [[happiness is not a real thing|"happiness" or "utility" that can be the objective of ethical maximization. In another piece,]] I argued that ordering states of the world according to how "good" they are, even to a single person, is likely an impossible task. 

In the movie *Anatomy of a Fall*, a woman is suspected of murdering her husband. Their son, Daniel, must testify in court, and he is conflicted, to say the least. Because Daniel still lives with his mom, the suspected murderer, the judge sends a monitor, Marge, to stay with him in the house. Daniel is initially suspicious of Marge, but they end up developing a bond. One day on a walk, in anguish, Daniel asks Marge if she thinks that his mom did it. [review this scene] She says she doesn't know. Daniel says he doesn't know either, and he doesn't know what he should say. Then Marge says, "il faut decide". But, I'm not sure, Daniel protests. But Marge says, "I'm not saying you have to be sure. I'm saying you have to decide."

What is important for Daniel in this situation is not to figure out, through some external source of information, who did it. It is instead to look inside and to decide, and to live with conviction in that decision, even if he technically cannot be sure. In some sense, the situation with happiness is very similar. You don't know for sure which decision will make you happiest (whatever that means), but you decide. We do this all the time. Even when bad things happen, people will often say that they "don't regret a thing". Why? because they've decided to live as if they've taken the best possible path, that it couldn't have been any better, that it had to be this way. They have *conviction*. But is this just delusion?

When I was deciding where to go to graduate school, a mentor of mine told me, "with things like this, it will always feel like you made the right decision". But how could both decisions be the right decision? If the right choice really is in some sense "best", then shouldn't there be something unique about it? There is — the fact that I chose it. 

There is something even realer about this than Daniel's situation. In Daniel's situation, there really is some ground truth, some inalterable reality, and in making his decision, the best he can do is live *as if* what he decided on were truth. But when it comes to happiness (of the well-being variety), the conviction really is enough. Simply believing in a decision *can* make you actually feel good about it. There is nothing delusional about this. In fact, on this view one might say that the happiness *consists in* this type of conviction in one's decision-making. That is, the decision-making itself has intrinsic value — it is not justified by any further good. 

Sometimes you hear talk about *purpose* or *meaning* in life, and it is undeniable that these notions are bound up with the idea of happy life. One account of purpose or meaning is exactly this: making decisions, big and small, according to some set of values, and having conviction in those decisions. And these values themselves are built on our decisions: by the decisions we have made and are making, both about what to value and how to act. This is not to say that values can be changed on a dime — they have inertia, so that our past decisions also make sense to us. But the point here is that decision is the essential component. That conviction that makes us feel good about our life trajectory comes from our having decided on it. To this worldview, then, freedom, construed as having the ability to decide, is *absolutely* fundamental. 

Of course, this is not to say that we had to decide on every detail of our situation to feel that conviction. Rather, the decision is a mixture of a decision to accept our constraints and to construct a life of our choosing within them (at the risk of invoking the "god grant me the serenity..." cliche).






What will make us happy is just as intractable as figuring out whether Daniel's mom murdered her husband. Probably more so. But the po



and so the best we can do is look at the choices people make, when unimpeded, to understand the wel
