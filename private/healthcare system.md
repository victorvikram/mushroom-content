I’ll start with things that we want our healthcare system to do:
- we want it to prioritize the things that will benefit people the most
- we want everyone, rich or poor, to be guaranteed quality care without going broke

These two desiderata conflict, because markets tend to be good at the first thing, while state-run systems are better at the latter. The system I lay out here will attempt to get the best of both worlds. 

The system does four things:
1. It creates a single marketplace for all healthcare goods and services
2. It charges patients as a percentage of their income
3. It pairs patients with an advocate who can help them navigate the market without a conflict of interests
4. It provides universal catastrophic insurance to all (whose deductible is also a percentage of income)

## 1. The market
People are always talking about how the US healthcare system sucks up so much money while still producing subpar outcomes. It is not difficult to see why. If the consumer is insured and a procedure is covered, the consumer doesn’t care about the price, and the producer wants the price to be as high as possible. The only downward force on costs is the insurance company, but they are ineffectual in this role:
1. They have limited negotiation power since they are only one of many insurers
2. Being a fairly distant third party, they don’t know the details of the case and therefore are not qualified to weigh the benefits of a procedure as compared with its costs
3. One of the insurers main instruments of price control, claim denials, don’t necessarily put pressure on the producer to reduce prices since they just transfer the burden of payment to the consumer 
4. Is there some sense in which insurers actually want healthcare costs to be higher on aggregate because they benefit from an economy that spends more on healthcare?



insurance company wants the price to be low, but has relatively little negotiation power as one of many insurers, and uses blunt instruments like denying claims as a method for keeping costs down. 

Markets have a simple solution to this. 

But there are three characteristics of the healthcare industry that make markets seem, at first, unsuitable for the domain:
1. Prices are opaque, and consumers often only discover them when they receive the bill in the mail
2. There is an information asymmetry between producers (doctors, hospitals, etc.) and consumers (patients)
3. The consumer is captive: if they don’t want to die, they *have to* pay for their treatment
4. 



Why a market? Because markets produce things whose cost is low compared to the benefit they produce.

Well, kind of. They prioritize things whose cost is low compared to the *willingness of the customer to pay*. And herein lies the problem: if a billionaire and I are both willing to pay ten dollars for something, I probably value it much more. So markets prioritize what rich people want even when they want those things less. The system I propose here is premised on the principle that for life-saving care, this is unfair. So in this marketplace for healthcare, consumers pay as a proportion of their income (this is invisible from the producer side, however — producers simply receive the price they quoted).

There is a final problem. Consumers are often ill-equipped to know exactly how much they will benefit from this or that drug or procedure, and it doesn’t help when the person trying to sell them that procedure knows much more than they do. That is why









The goal of this healthcare market is to prioritize the things that people value. Markets do this, *kind of*. They prioritize the thing that people are willing to pay the most for. But 

Markets are cool because if something values something for ten dollars and it causes less than that to produce, someone will produce it. And, the more people value a thing the more incentive there is to produce it. 

The system has several components:
- market
- advocate
- research

## The market 
Arguments against the market to address:
- the information asymmetry
- captive customer
- unfairness
- even things that don’t make a profit should be produced 






idea #1: 
You have a completely equal market. you do it by allocating everyone healthcare dollars that can only be spent on healthcare. my sense is, the best way to do this is to somehow measure how much benefit the person can derive from good healthcare. how could this be decided? they can be spent as the patient pleases, and they turn into real money upon being spent. maybe some “real dollars” can be spent as an olive branch to rich people, but perhaps this will be limited? on top of this I think there needs to be a mandatory insurance system because (1) society can’t let people die when they can’t pay but (2) if people know this they won’t pay for the insurance.

another idea: you pay for everything but as a proportion of your income. does that make sense? but of course doctors, hospitals, etc. will quote in dollar terms. so how do you convert a dollar amount to a proportion of income? i guess you take the dollar amount, you see what percentage of income it would be for the average person, and you make that the price. the person then pays, and the provider is compensated according to their original quote. does this make sense?

idea #2:
as much as possible, to incentivize the formation of health collectives that are completely public and basically just try to keep patients healthy. maybe this is the primary health system? but here it works in a very simple way, maybe it’s that the collectives are compensated according to how many patients take them as their primary care group. or maybe there’s some bidding here too. these people should also be your defenders, the people who vouch for you, etc.

idea #3
you have medical groups that bid on how much they would take on a patient for. that bid is a commitment to providing them care for a certain period of time, maybe 5-10 years. the patient can then choose among the bids. i was thinking that the cheapest one would be free, but that is an arbitrary cutoff point. I could combine this with the equality market idea and say people use their healthcare dollars to buy this. there should likely be some guarantee that your dollars will be enough to cover some of these plans

idea #4
for research, you can equally allocated dollars to experts who then have to allocate that money to funding requests. there can also be a system where a certain set of people gets allocated an amount of research funds that they can keep for their own research. and finally, there should be a way of compensating labs that produce 

combined idea. 
- you make a market for healthcare where everyone pays for stuff as a percentage of their income. within the system of course everything is paid in dollars, but any charge to the consumer is then converted to income percentage. this is for things approved by one’s doctor as “health expenditures”
- you create a public component which is where you go for all your primary care, and the idea is for this to be the caring part, where here your doctor is your advocate, etc. this component is also where you get advice on general well-being, your doctor can prescribe diets, exercise, etc. your doctor can also help decide between different providers for services, looking at reviews, etc. need to figure out the means of compensating these people but they should be on your side
- maybe a required insurance plan for catastrophic care where insurers bid for patients and again everything is then (1) paid as a percentage of income and (2) deductibles are as a percentage of income. but insurance plans need to be simple: like anything over a certain expense is covered. 
- medical research subsidized by (1) giving money to experts and asking them to allocate money in places that look promising and (2) compensating labs for innovations that they developed, but not allowing patents
- is the idea of a medical group something that is wanted, or should we just see if the market provides it? the only problem is that it probably takes a lot of coordination to put together a medical group
- competition-enhancing policy — how do you ensure the presence of enough providers that there actually is a good level of competition
1. costs are always as a proportion of income (or wealth?)
2. all records of pricing, costs, etc. are public. same with bidding, a specific proposal is given for a specific price. and your records are also in this central service (though not public)
3. there is a public component that is like, your advocate
4. everyone needs a catastrophic plan to avoid bankruptcies etc.
5. some form of anti-monopolistic policy. but for this i need to understand, in general, what leads to the rise of monopolies and if there are a set of ruels of the game that can prevent them

questions:
- how is it determined what should be eligible as a health expenditure and therefore you can do proportionally (and also counts towards your catastrophic deductible). should there be a good cop bad cop kind of thing where your doctor tries to allow more stuff and 
- how can we designate things as *only* payable as a percentage. because of course the rich would like to just circumvent that and pay under the table. there could then be a black market of healthcare that emerges. eek! that is of course also a problem with health dollars. there should be some things that can optionally be paid as percentage, and some stuff that must be. any kind of medical procedure i guess has to be. 
- does this system actually prioritize increase in quality of life per dollar spent? i guess proportion of income spent is a good indication of increase in quality of life, esp if you are guided by a primary care doctor who is knowledgeable
- should there be something about health savings accounts that also work on this percentage system? how should it work for senior citizens
- how to prevent anti-competitive practices. this is a more general question
- the more general question is: do markets optimize benefit per unit cost? in what sense do they, or don’t they?
- would it work if everything was done *optionally* as a percentage? this would prevent the possibility of a black market. of course, this would limit the subsidization of the whole operation by the rich. but if the prices are high enough maybe it’s ok. or like, it would be like this. everyone can buy healthcare dollars, but as a proportion of your income. or you could just use regular dollars

desiderata:
- your doctors have an incentive to keep you healthy in the long run
- cases are prioritized based on the increase in quality of life per dollar spent
- new, innovative ways of doing healthcare can spring up without being regulated out of existence
- \[possibly, as an olive branch to rich people] maybe there is some option to pay down the systemwide cost of the procedure and to be thereby prioritized
- all costs are transparent and there is an auction whenever possible where different providers submit bids for (1) price and (2) timing. Also all reviews and such are public, too, and verified, etc.
- all records and transactions are maintained in a centralized system. cut drastically down on the administrative overhead
- doctor is basically like your lawyer, your advocate in the system. and maybe there are times when a bad cop is needed, for instance, in deciding how much you get as your yearly expenditure
