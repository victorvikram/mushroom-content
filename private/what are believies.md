This piece seeks to define what it is we are studying when we talk about beliefs. What do we really want to understand? In this piece I'd like to think about models of beliefs that others have proposed, and also think about the kinds of things we might want to understand by making models of beliefs. Let's go. 

The "usefulness" entry point
1. We might want to have notions of distance between people, to quantify how much they agree on things. Perhaps this notion of distance could also be used to 
2. We might want to understand how beliefs interact with one another, to understand what sets of beliefs are compatible and which ones are incompatible. 
3. We may want to explain in a "low dimensional" way what people think - can we identify the major components of people's values?
4. We might want to know what a collective "thinks". Of course it is not quite clear what this means. What does it mean for a person to think something? It means that they have some representation about the world that they believe to be true, I guess. Does it make sense for a collective to have a representation? And does it makes sense to say that the collective believes a thing to be true? It could be that it acts in a way that is "as if" it were true. For instance in betting markets, or stock markets, one can see based on prices and things what the collective thinks. If the prices don't change when something happens, then a some sense the collective thought that it was going to happen
5. We may want to know how some more rudimentary components collapse into the expression of a belief. Because really, what happens when someone is asked any high-level belief question? Things start to marinate 
6. We may want to understand how people will act in a variety of contexts. For this 

The linguistic entry point
1. People might mean sort of a proposition, a thing about that world that you think is true. A statement that can be verified or not. These include predictions about the future, or causal models of the world, etc. Usually it is something that you are not certain is true, but you believe to be.
2. Sometimes something that someone thinks that they know would be externally considered a belief it is in fact false. So in this case a belief can seem like knowledge to the holder of the belief 
3. They might mean a value judgment, basically a belief about whether something is good or bad, or right or wrong. Here a belief 
4. There is also a connotation of "faith" or "trust" in the notion of beliefs. 
5. They may be looser kinds of things, associations. Things you view as being related to one another. 
6. They don't necessarily have to be active in consciousness. It matters only that when someone asks us something, we answer in a certain way. We don't even have to be aware we have the belief.
7. We can ahve a belief that we're not aware of, only aware of it once it is contradicted
