I was talking to a friend the day after the 2024 presidential election, and she said, "well he did win the popular vote this time, so it *is* the will of the people.". For some reason this caused a twinge of anger to well up in me, and I replied with an edge of indignance, "just because the majority says something doesn't make it right". This outburst signaled a combination of sore-loser-crybaby and anti-democracy-elitist that I am quite embarrassed about. And while I may be a sore loser (and a crybaby!) I am certainly *not* anti-democratic. So, let me explain myself. 

The thing that caused my kneejerk negative reaction to my friend's statement was the leap from a vague ideal — wanting to follow the will of the people — to endorsing a very specific instantiation of that ideal — our current system of government. This is not a trivial leap. It involves answering a lot of foundational questions, including: 
1) On which decisions should we follow the will of the people? 
2) Which people's wills should we follow?
3) How do you measure the will of even a single person?
4) How do we deduce the will of "the people" from the will of many individuals?

Here is how our current system of government answers these questions
1) People have a say in what the government does. Besides that, private property reigns: your stuff, your rules.
2) Every government has a set of citizens who are eligible to vote according to the rules of that government. 
3) We come up with a list of options, and ask people which one they prefer
4) We see which option was preferred by the most people, and we choose that one. 

I think that expanding it out this way should raise some serious questions about our government's approach to measuring the "will of the people". The first two questions deal with *partitioning*. First, partitioning decisions into "public" and "private", with "public" ones to be decided by the will of the people. Second, partitioning people into "citizens" and "noncitizens", where citizens have a say and noncitizens don't. The next two points deal with *measurement*: how to measure the will of a single person, and then how to aggregate that into a measurement of the overall will of the people. 
## 1. Partitioning
The answer to the first question might strike some as circular. Which decisions should be subject to the will of the people? Things relating to what the government does. But what does the government do? Things that the people want it to do. So shouldn't I have just said that the things subject to the will of the people are whatever the people want?

%% I should offer a solution to putting things up for democratic decision. because really i think there are two "moralities" at play: people should have a say in the decisions that affect them, and people should have a say in the decisions where they've earned the right to have a say in. this, I think, is one foundational problem to collective decision-making %%

Well, no. The general purview of what the government does is mostly decided by something completely outside of what could be called the will of the people. Here are the main factors
1. *Hard boundaries.* By this I mean the constitutional limits of what a government is allowed to do. Think of the enumerated powers in Article I of the constitution, or the limitations set on the government by the Bill of Rights. These may been somewhat democratically decided on at some point (when the constitution was ratified), but the idea that they reflect the general will at present is certainly dubious.
2. *Soft boundaries.* 
3. *Inertia.* 
4. **

It is hard to believe that the strange agglomeration of government activities that this set of factors produces are really the things that should be put up to the general will. And even if it were, there is another problem: what is put up to the general will may be somewhat malleable, but the agent set to execute that general will (the government) is set in stone. It is, somehow, *prior to* the general will. This is a problem for two reasons.

First, it preordains who will be the spokesperson of the people. To use the US as an example, the spokesperson of the people is a three-branch federal state with x, y, z properties. I can give an example of this. For instance, I do believe that people should have a say in, for instance, how social media algorithms work, especially if they are a monopoly. But to have my voice mediated by a term-limit-free Senate whose geriatric members are clueless as to how Facebook even makes money makes me question whether a government-regulated facebook would do 

And second, it preordains the scale of decision-making. 


- hard boundaries are undemocratic (constitution, supreme court, etc.) why?
- soft boundaries: things that have money or special interests behind them. starting an effort requires effort.
- discourse setting
- inertia
- property norms
- what if the government is a bad messenger for our wills? it is our only choice
point 2:
- governments and their citizens are pre-givens
- always will be a matter of gatekeeping. give zoning example. also US foreign policy etc.
point 3
- what options show up.
	- money and special interests again
	- party primaries as a special case of this
- the combinatorial space
point 4
- no matter how much it affects you, you have the same vote
- no discussion, just individual registration 
- no consideration of second choices, etc.
- voting a public good
