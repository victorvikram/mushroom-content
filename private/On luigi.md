I don't think I will publish this because it will get me in trouble. But here are some rapid-fire thoughts on what I think about Luigi Mangione

1. *"Murder is always wrong, but I understand where he is coming from" is a cop-out stance.* Most people don't think murder is *always* wrong. Many people support the death penalty. Even people who don't support the death penalty supported killing Osama Bin Laden. So if says Brian Thompson's murder was wrong because "murder is always wrong", they either have to convince me that they really think that murder is, in fact, always wrong, or they have to tell me what the dividing line is between Brian Thompson and any other serial killer out there.

2. *Would you be sad if a mobster was shot dead?* 
3. *Brian Thompson was a serial killer*. Draconian cost-cutting and coverage denials from health insurance companies, most prominently United Healthcare, have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Americans. Denying fewer insurance claims was well within Brian Thompson's power as CEO (given a claims rejection rate double the already-abysmal industry standard). He didn't do it.

7. *We can't confuse ourselves with different sorts of judgments.* Here are some things you might be feeling right now: you might *like* Luigi, or you might hate him. You might think what he did was wrong, or right. You might think he is a hero, or a villain. You might feel happy and empowered, or sad and hopeless. You might find it funny, or serious. You might think what he did was a net positive, or a net negative. It is possible to consistently think any combination of these things. There are people I like who have done bad things. There are times when something that is morally wrong nonetheless has positive consequences. There are times when heroes do. the wrong thing 
8. *Political violence* does *have a place in American society.* And not because I said so. The second amendment was designed to allow for the creation of 
9. *It has been sad to see a moment of solidarity cleaved into a partisan issue.*
10. *People would be supporting Luigi even if he was ugly.*
11. *Trumpers are right: the mainstream media is lying to us.*
12. *We should give Luigi the win*
