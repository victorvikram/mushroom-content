Someone I follow shared a short video recently, by Andrew Tate, with the disclaimer that he believes Andrew Tate is a "psychopathic asshole" (an assessment I agree with). You know someone really buys into a message when they will share it as it rolls out of a psychopath's mouth, so I couldn't resist a watch. In the video, Andrew Tate criticizes most prominent personalities for being bought and paid for by "gatekeepers". He frames it as a conspiracy: that anyone rising in the ranks is first offered money and an elevated platform in exchange for (implicitly or explicitly) silence on certain topics. If this doesn't work, they (whoever they are) move to mafia-esque threats: if you don't take our offer of "protection" — our PR team, our platform, our lawyers — we will turn it against you. 

I would like to simultaneously dispute and extend what Andrew Tate is saying here. First, the pushback. I suspect the campaign to control what people are saying is not a willful, coordinated conspiracy as Tate seems to imply. *However*, it doesn't need to be. I will describe how this machinery of control can operate autonomously. And then the extension: it is not just what people *say*, but also, and perhaps more importantly, what people can *do* that is regulated by this machinery of control. 

We need to first recognize that we are plugged into a system. All of human society is an organism, an organism that harvests resources from the ground and energy from (ultimately) the sun. We transform this energy and these resources into things, into information, into cities, into motion and interactions and institutions and culture. As we do all this, we excrete waste products back into the air and the earth. 

Like an organism, which has tissues of cells that perform a particular functions (like nervous tissue or muscle tissue), the societal organism has a "functional groupings", socially-structured clusters of people and materials (think of a hierarchically organized company with employees and assembly lines for manufacturing, or a departmentally-organized university with students and professors and buildings and computers).

The argument of this essay is that (1) these functional groupings arise spontaneously, without necessarily willful intervention, (2) that the logic of the autonomous process that gives rise to the functional groupings favors stability, and (3) that as a result of this trend towards stability, there exists a "machinery of control" that inhibits people who might otherwise have been inclined to disrupt the status quo — even when the change they would create would be positive.

When I say "function", do I mean that there is some behind-the-scenes designer who has conspired to relegate people to certain functional roles? I don't. Think of an organism, which has no designer. Yet, we have tissues *for* a particular function because those tissues, at some point in our evolutionary history, proved helpful in the endeavors of surviving and reproducing. Because the organisms inhabited by these useful tissues are more effective survivors and reproducers, those tissues are likely to live on.

While "survival and reproduction" is not as clear-cut in societies, evolution is still at play. This is where the organism analogy begins to break down a bit, so bear with me. I previously said society was an organism, but one could say that it is much less cohesive than an organism. Imagining a world prior to globalization 

These modules either function so that they survive in their current organizational configuration, or they die. The dead modules might then be replaced by other configurations. Eventually, a particularly stable structure will emerge and persist. 

This is the evolutionary process undergone by society: one that enhances its stability. Just as we should expect natural selection to lead to organisms that are better at surviving and reproducing, we should expect societal evolution to lead to stable societies. There is no need for a plan here, or for intention. It happens completely autonomously. 

Now we can return to the machinery of control. The machinery of control, while detrimental to human flourishing, is likely a stabilizing force, and we should expect it therefore to be selected. But this sounds all abstract and, dare I say, conspiratorial (even though I have shown how we can get such machinery *sans* consipracy!). So let me give a few examples. What sorts of people might threaten the status quo?
- deep and critical thinkers — people in the habit of questioning stuff are likely to wonder at times about the social order. What gives anyone the right to own land? They bought it? And the first owner? They can just take it? And what about money? Where does it come from? Why do people who have it also get to have more power? Why do we expect demor ? The questions are endless and important. Notice, though, that few people make a living trying to answer them. Where do the deep thinkers go? There aren't that many tissues in the societal organism where they would thrive; perhaps the main one is academia. And look at what academia does to them: it funnels them into hyperspecialized, niche fields, spending their time answering hard questions with few 
- people who want to "change the world" — it is telling that Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are the heroes of many young people who want to change the world. It tells us that there are no societal tissues available for those who want to change our social machinery, our economic systems, perhaps, or our political systems. Instead, the world changers simply create tools: tools that make carrying out our existing functions easier, quicker, faster, more efficiently. But when these "world changers" rarely actually change the fundamentals of how society operates, and when they do, it's often unintended (and disastrous) consequences — I'm looking at you, Zuck. 
- creatives and communicators — this is notoriously a difficult 
- activists becoming obsessed with wokeness
- politicians re
- ambitious people — smart people used to hearing that they are "going places" have been conditioned from a young age to compete for prestige. To go to an ivy league. To work at one of the big three or big four in whatever industry they've chosen. To become managing director, or make partner, or get tenure. In the end, the people who've been able to jump through these hoops have the money and the power. And . When at the commencement speeches of Harvard and Princeton they say "you are the leaders of tomorrow", it's not true for all of them. Some of them, sure. Which ones? The ones that are willing to bow to the leaders of today.

You will notice that these people, as they become neutered by a society concerned about their disruptive potential, need not be privy to the imperative of stability selecting for such mechanisms of control. Instead, the signal is usually money. You do the thing that makes you a living. It is no accident that society-disrupting endeavors don't make you a living: a society that financed roles dedicated to its disruption would not last long.

This is despite the fact that questioning the fundamental operation of our political and economic system has the potential to create an immense public good. How many social ills today are caused by suboptimal 

And even when it doesn't, the . This is despite the fact many of these people would 

Things to do
- make the account of societal evolution more explicit
- public goods and market failures
- we don't usually think of the lack of earning potential as an inhibition on freedom, but it is exactly this way that the social organism limits our freedom
- can i come up with a more cohesive metaphor than "the machinery of control" + the social organism?
- fill in the accounts of the different stabilizing forces
- write a section on consequences
	- the more powerful you are, the more beholden you are to the social order. but the causation is complicated. 
	- you might criticize me for not substantiating my claims with explanations. but the logic of evolution permits this
	- the blame game is counterproductive
	- DEI won't do anything
	- where is there hope for change
	- can you ever have a society willing to change, if evolution favors stability
	- Andrew Tate's conclusion about sovereignty and why this is untenable
