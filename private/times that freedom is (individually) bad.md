This piece is simply a catalog of times when more freedom is not better. I do this as an exercise, because we get so used to thinking of freedom as a good thing — at least on an individual level. Importantly, I will leave aside freedom's issues at a collective level, since these are much easier to see. I will also consider the most basic notion of freedom: the absence of (external) obstacles to do what one might want to do.
### 1. Suboptimal smarts

*A man is looking for a job out of business school. He recently got married, and he and her wife are trying to set themselves up financially for raising a family. He has two offers: one from a boutique bank and the other from a large firm. The boutique bank is offering a higher salary, but its smaller network and prestige may open fewer doors down the line.*

*But in a conversation with his wife, he tells her that the boutique bank is located an hour outside of the city, so they wouldn't be able to live downtown. Her wife, a city girl through and through, isn't having it. Just pick the other one! Practically relieved that the choice is made for him, he accepts the large firm's offer. Still, the man has a nagging doubt — in the back of his head is an offer from a friend to help him start an alternative economics think tank...lower paid, by a long shot, but actually interesting...*

Under this category is all the deficiencies preventing us from making the decision that we would know is best for us in the absence of those deficiencies. This can a deficiency in information (for instance, when buying cleaning products in the grocery store we may not be aware of its harmful ingredients) or a deficiency in our capacity to process that information. Cognitive biases are one example of us routinely making suboptimal decisions (even given the information we have available), perhaps as a result of misusing heuristics that have evolved for other purposes. Sometimes the problem isn't a systematic bias, however, but just a lack of "cleverness" — I may know where I am trying to go (say, spending a minimum on groceries subject to certain constraints), but I just don't have the mental capacity to calculate what the minimum-cost shopping cart is. On certain occasions, however, the issue is more fundamental. We can call it a lack of "wisdom", and this involves a misunderstanding of what we are aiming for in the first place. Often in religion there is talk of a hapless sinner who didn't know any better, but some realization showed him the error of his ways. Buddhists, for instance, believe that a true, experiential understanding of how the universe works (and what brings true happiness) would automatically make one virtuous. 
### 2. Costly calculation

*A student was just admitted to three universities she is very excited about . Her older cousin, who has helped her a lot in the process, has told her that "whatever you decide, it will feel like the right choice". Still, she can't stop digging for all the information she can about each school. She visits each of them — two of them even twice — and is emailing students, professors, and alums nonstop to hear their impressions of each school. Finally, she feels herself converging on a decision. She mentions this to her cousin, who excitedly tells her she should just decide now. But still, she says, I'd like to learn more about their political activist scenes... Her cousin stops her: "you know so much now that learning about their political scenes won't change your decision, it will only make it harder. just decide now." She does, with relief.*

Even if we have the capacity to compute the best decision for ourselves, it could well be that the computation is costly to us, and it would have been worth it to outsource the calculation to someone else — even if they would have come up with a slightly worse outcome for us. Costs of decision-making take many forms. Time is the most obvious one. Decision-making can also take energy, resulting in decision fatigue. Information overload can lead us to spend both excessive time and energy on a decision. But this isn't the only reason information is costly. Sometimes, the information required to make a decision is itself harmful, and once we know it, we can't un-know it. If you live in the matrix and someone tells you the truth about your situation, giving you the option to leave, you may well feel as if you were better off never knowing . Similarly, if you go on a date with someone that goes really well, and you have another promising date planned in a couple of days, you may decide to cancel because you don't even want to know what that other person is like — she might make your decision more difficult, and may open the door to your feeling regret down the line for making the wrong decision.

### 3. Internal conflict

*A man is deciding whether to go out with his friends or to stay home and make some progress on a project he'd been putting off for a while. He calls it a passion project, and it is something he's excited about, but sometimes it's hard to just sit down and do it.  He told himself he'd finally get it moving this weekend, and it's Sunday afternoon, so it's now or never. But, he hasn't seen his friends in a while, and he did say he'd hang out with them this weekend. Ah and hanging out at the beach feels like just what he needs...At the same time, he knows they'll be drinking, and has been trying, with difficulty, to cut down in recent months. He knows he'll drink if he goes out, even if he promises himself he won't.*

Sometimes the calculation in making a decision is not itself difficult, but the . Addiction is a classic example of this, where some part of our brain wants something while the other part doesn't endorse this "base" desire. But we have internal conflict even without addiction. We are motivated by many things: obtaining pleasure, maintaining a consistent self-image, gaining others' respect, feeling satisfaction in life, being at peace, etc., and it is often unclear how to make these different motivations commensurate in a way that identifies the correct path forward. 

### 4. Joy in decision

*A woman arrives home on Friday evening to a card from her husband, congratulating her on the promotion she'd received that day. In the card are two tickets to see dance company visiting from Denmark — what a nice idea! Let's celebrate tomorrow evening, he writes. I booked your favorite restaurant for tomorrow evening, and afterwards we can go see the dance. She hugs the card to her chest and goes to find where he's hiding.*

When the right path isn't so clear, sometimes people value having it decided for them. I've noticed this in my relationships, when my partner often likes it when I pick and reserve a restaurant for our date night. Of course, there are many reasons for this: wanting to see that I put in effort, or to receive a recommendation from me, or to escape decision fatigue. I think these are certainly part of it. But I suspect also that sometimes, there is simply value in just having a matter decided. It creates comfort, it quiets uncertainty, it gives us purpose, it can even produce excitement at being "swept off one's feet". This also comes up in religion. Often Buddhist meditation practices start with taking refuge in the buddha, which amounts to expressing faith in the Buddha's teaching, *even if* one hasn't yet fully experienced its value for oneself. There is value in this: it can be difficult to make progress in meditation if you're constantly questioning what you are doing. Deciding on a path (in this case, the Buddha's teaching), and expressing faith quiets all of that uncertainty. It can also create direction and purpose. This is likely part of the reason that many religions emphasize faith — even Buddhism, which is known to place high value on one's own personal experience.

### 5. Generativity in constraint

*A student of Buddhist meditation receives instructions from his teacher. There is a meditation center in the foothills of the mountains, where must go with only himself and his clothes: no books, no electronics, no writing instruments. He will be served food twice a day — but not past noon — and otherwise he must follow a rigorous meditation schedule. No talking is allowed. He goes.*

A decision is an extreme constraint, a chosen path forward. But sometimes when the matter is not completely settled, but there are constraints on . I know that it is right before I do my groceries, when my cupboards are most empty, that I come up with my most creative new dishes. Just watermelon, mascarpone, lime, and chili pepper around? How about spicy lime-mascarpone watermelon bites? This is not just a me thing. Poets who write in iambic pentameter, or any other meter, have known that constraining the space of possibilities can be creatively generative. The ingenuity and resourcefulness that constraints can generate in us or not only sources of value for the world — Shakespearean sonnets and my wonderful watermelon recipe — but also sources of pride for ourselves.
### 6. Collective membership

*
*
I've been fairly individual-focused in my enumeration of the benefits to constraints. The other is that there is intrinsic value in being part of a group, and that constraints necessarily arise from being part of the group. But in my eyes, it would be wrong to say that "membership in a group is beneficial *despite* the constraints it imposes on the individual". I think that in some ways, membership in a group is beneficial *because* of the constraints it imposes. When the path forward for a collective is not clear, and not everyone can get what they want, getting together and hammering out a way forward is itself valuable. But it would be misleading to say that it is only in decision points like this that people gain value from constraints. We don't explicitly celebrate conformism in the west, but the fact remains that even joining a group without doing anything to change it — adopting its norms, its manners, its *constraints* — provides many with a sense of belonging and identity, of coherence, that is valuable to them. 
### 7. Lacking affordances
Even if nothing is preventing you from doing something, 


### 6. Guidance 
Decisions, however, aren't only valuable by virtue of being decisions. If the decision comes from a reliable source, . Kids listening to their parents, students listening to their teachers, and friends listening their friends all know that sometimes outside guidance . Is this just me saying, in different words, that guidance from others can help compensate for either "suboptimal smarts" or "costly calculation"? Possibly

There is a common thread with many of these examples that is suggestive. In xx, the woman who enjoys when her boyfriend "takes care of things" would likely not say that she feels unfree, in fact, she would likely say the opposite. Similarly, the smoker trying to quit, faced with shelves of cigarettes behind the counter, is likely not experiencing what he would call freedom. Somehow, when more choice feels *worse* to us, we are disinclined to call it freedom.
