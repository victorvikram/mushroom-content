After Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson, the United Healthcare CEO, I’ve been hearing a lot of people saying, “murder is wrong, but…”

I’ve been very curious to know what this “but” means. Logically, a “but” is equivalent to an “and”. It says that the first clause is true *and* the second clause is true. But we use a “but” when it would be somehow surprising, somehow incongruous, for the two things to go together. 

- “liking” Luigi
- thinking Luigi is a good person
- thinking Luigi is a hero
- thinking the murder will have a positive impact
- thinking the murder is *funny*
- thinking the murder is empowering
- thinking the murder is fair
- not *condoning*, but *understanding*
- thinking this was a natural consequence of what came before

What is the thing that I have been trying to verbalize?
I am sad about the murder, but not because 


Implications:
- to give Luigi the win, or not?
- how much should we make an example of him?
- how harsh to be on his punishment?
- what are relevant details? that he was wealthy? that he was never insured by United? that he was mentally ill?
