I say I’m not a consequentialist, because 
- I don’t think there is something we can measure to be able to say how “good” the world is, overall. People might default
	- happiness can be many things: peace, pleasure, joy, being loved, … (give examples of experiences that are happy). are these all the same thing? can we collapse it down into 
	- maybe you still think you can order it on some scale of goodness. I disagree with this too. extend it to a whole life
- Measurements of welfare and suffering cease to make sense as soon as death and birth are involved. What if a sad person is born? Does that increase, or decrease welfare? You might take a number of stances on it: (1) 
	- what if a sad person is born?
	- how sad do you have to be to cause negative welfare? where is the dividing line?
	- if any life is better than no life, shouldn’t you just populate to the highest degree possible?
	- death you  can just reframe as killing a sad person
- how do you weight people?
- it means you have no leeway. to the extent that you do have leeway, you’re non consequentialist

most kinds of deontological rules end up being justified consequentially: why is murder wo

### Death and birth
Perhaps one answer is that life is valuable until the being becomes suicidal. But this poses problems. First, it would mean that we shouldn’t prevent someone from committing suicide, as it would make the world better off. And second, everyone probably has a different threshold for what it would take them to commit suicide. 
### Meaning
Why do we have ethics? Why do we need to say that some things are good, and some things are bad? In a world without living things, it is pretty clear that there is no room for ethics: things just happen; they are neither good nor bad.

But morality doesn’t spring onto the scene at the same time that life does. Surely, in a world of bacteria, it remains the case that things just happen. 

Levels of purpose: autonomous purpose, where information builds on itself. things survive 

is purpose the root of morality? 

is it just that we need it? and how is this different from pain and pleasure

In a world with humans, most people would intuit that ethics . Where in the interim did they come into being?

One possible answer is that where there is suffering (and its mirror, well-being), there is ethics.

But while this may be part of what matters, it cannot be all the matters. In fact, I am not even sure that it is most of what matters. Let me give a couple of examples:
- An omnivorous bear kills and eats a deer. Would the world have been better if the bear had woken up and decided to eat plants?
- Imagine there was a hermit in the woods, living a very happy life. Now suppose you could kill him entirely painlessly, without him or anyone else knowing. Would it be wrong to kill him? What if you could kill him via a drug injection 

Regarding the first question, I think most people would say that we should kill the elephant. Yet it is far from clear that elephants feel less pain than humans do. And regarding the second, I think most people would

(of course, you need living things to reason about ethics, but imagine a bunch )
