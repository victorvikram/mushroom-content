This alternative is based on an overarching principle: people 
- action-based rather than constraint-based governance 
- political gravity

On power
A society contains people and resources, and it can do many things with them. The question is, what should it do? Our machinery of collective action provides a few solutions to this problem. *Markets* accomplish the task by renumerating people who can do things that other people will pay them for. *Democracies* do this by giving a certain number of people a vote, and going with the will of the majority. *Hierarchies* create a chain of command where every level has command over all levels below. There are also three different logics justifying these different systems. 
- *people should have sway in decisions in which they have earned sway*
- *people should have sway in decisions that affect them*
- *people should have sway in decisions where they are equipped to make the best choice*
