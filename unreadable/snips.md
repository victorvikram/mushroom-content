The objective of this piece is twofold â€” it is both to offer a working definition of freedom and simultaneously to present some arguments for why freedom is so important. One might think that we should first start with freedom's definition and then move on to arguing for freedom's virtues. I believe this is the wrong approach, however, because the reason freedom is useful as a concept is that it is desirable. So we must pick a definition that somehow possesses the desirable qualities that we think freedom should have.
