Before the US Tiktok ban bill even made it through the House of Representatives, you had activists, content creators, and wedding cake bakeries lamenting that their right to freedom of speech had been infringed upon. And to be fair, it does seem pretty clear cut: people on the platform are almost like their own little broadcasters; shutting down the platform seems akin to shutting down, for example, a broadcast network.

But the analogy doesn't work. Imagine if Bytedance, Tiktok's parent company, decided to shut down Tiktok in the United States. This would result in the same limitations on free speech that Tiktok's denizens are complaining about now. Yet, in the judgment of most, this action is perfectly permissible. Somehow, Bytedance's *ownership* of the platform, and their consequent right to shut it down, supersedes any claims to freedom of speech by participants on the platform[^1].

The shutdown example is extreme. What about moderation? Well, if we carry forward the same logic, Tiktok — and not its users — being the entity owning the platform, should be allowed to control what appears on it. I should note that it is unclear whether the Supreme Court actually would carry forward that logic (not least because Tiktok is foreign-owned), but they will be ruling on the question with the cases *NetChoice v. Paxton* and *Moody v. NetChoice*[^2].  

A relevant precedent is *Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo*. At issue was a Florida state law guaranteeing candidates a right to reply to content about them. Tornillo, a candidate for the Florida House of Representatives, claimed to have the right to reply in the *Miami Herald*, to unflattering editorials published about him in that newspaper. While Florida's law was an effort to guarantee candidates an equal platform, the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional, deeming publishing companies' editorial control of the contents of their newspapers protected speech. That is, the Miami Herald had the right to control what appeared on their "platform" (that is, the newspaper) because *they owned it*. 

This is not to say that people speaking platforms owned by others have no claims to freedom of speech, but it is to say that when push comes to shove, we often prioritize the property rights of platform owners above mere participants. This also manifests in the workplace: in the US, private employees do not have the right to free speech in the workplace. This accords with many people's intuition, if you are on private property, working for a private company, the management and ownership of the company can include you or exclude you as they please. Why? Because they own the company[^3].

So the freedom to do as you please with your property and the freedom to speak as you please come in conflict, especially when a particular platform for speech (whether a soapbox, a workplace, a broadcast channel, or a social media site) is owned by a private actor. But this highlights something even more fundamental about freedom of speech, which is that *free speech requires infrastructure*.

Freedom of speech, and freedoms in general, are often thought of as a *negative rights*: they consist in powers that you have by default that should not be taken away. Usually rights to life, free speech, and security against search and seizure are thought of as negative rights. An apt image is a crossroads with many roads available to you. Freedom in this image is represented by the absence of roadblocks. By contrast, a positive right is something that must be given to you; it is paired with the responsibility of someone else, usually the state, to provide it. This includes the rights to voting, healthcare, or housing. Positive rights in the previous pictures are paths forward that must be built, or at least maintained.

American libertarians, self-professed as the most freedom-absolutist party in America, often reject the notion of positive rights, such as Bernie Sanders' "right to free healthcare". They say that healthcare cannot be a right because to ensure healthcare requires someone else's labor, and you cannot be entitled to the sweat of anyone else's brow.

But I posit that even rights that *seem* to be negative rights, like the right to life and speech, also require the sweat of someone else's brow. I made the point above that free speech requires infrastructure: a platform from which your voice can carry. This infrastructure was built by somebody. Life, too, requires infrastructure: access to food, to shelter, and yes, to healthcare. Unplugged from all societal infrastructure, most of us would not be alive, let alone free.

To have a tenable notion of a negative right, then, there must be a zero-point, a default set of roads open to us, that is not absolute zero. Guarantees to roads in addition to these would be positive rights, while guarantees that the base-level roads not be taken away would be negative rights. In practice, we often take this zero point to be "whatever we have access to now", and we take the negative guarantees to be stronger than the positive ones. 

Imagine another alternate scenario. Let us say that Tiktok did not exist, and instead, the US outlawed any hypothetical (but non-existent) foreign-adversary-controlled social media platforms with over a certain number of users. Would similar complaints ensue? Likely not. After all, no Americans would have their speech curtailed in this action. So banning an existing platform is worse than preventing it from coming into existence, because we take our zero point to be the current state of affairs. But why should the status quo hold such sway over what we deem the *right* state of affairs? Ignoring transition costs for a moment, should it not be true that if a foreign-controlled social media network is wrong in a world where it does not exist yet, it should also be wrong in a world where it already exists? 

This article is not [[freedom of speech on social media|a full analysis of freedom of speech on social media]]. I bring up the Tiktok example simply to highlight two central concerns that make the seemingly easy idea of freedom into a tricky one. These are the questions of how to reconcile
1. *personal rights* (like freedom of speech) when they seem to conflict with the *property rights* of owners (like Bytedance of Tiktok),
2. *positive rights* of people (like the right to a *platform* to speak), which I argue are actually hidden in many of the rights we usual consider "negative", when they seem to implicitly impose constraints on the freedom others (like Tiktok's right to decide what goes on their platform)

The project of this article is to take steps towards building a conception of freedom that reconciles these tensions. But to say that a particular reconciliation of these tensions is a "good" one requires a measuring stick for what a good conception of freedom should do, and for that we need to clarify why we care about freedom in the first place (Section 1). Later, with that argument in hand, we can verify that our "rebuilt" version of freedom preserves the qualities of freedom that we care about.
## 1. Why freedom
paulina story about freedom in bratislava

Why should we care about freedom
1. pluralism about what the good life is
2. simple optimization principle where more choices is better
3. that agency is good in itself
4. the learning principle
5. Authenticity, being true to oneself
6. Happiness proxy

Outline from here:
- why freedom. 
- solutions to the challenges outlined above: the territorial sovereign approach. why it fails miserably
- the default to now approach for negative vs. positive rights. why it also fails 
- complex systems notion of freedom

[^2]: I should clarify that despite my references to US Supreme Court cases, I am not particularly interested in the nuances of exactly how the court interprets the First Amendment. Rather, the objective is to provide interesting border cases to help us think through what freedom of speech (and by extension, freedom), really mean.
