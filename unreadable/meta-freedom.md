[a story here highlighting a contradiction of freedom. something actually interesting, or funny, or something.]
Freedom is almost universally regarded as something "good". That there is more agreement on freedom's *value* than on its *definition* leads to a question: is freedom an unqualified good? Answering this is difficult, in part because of what I just said: people don't really agree on the definition. So let's revise the question a bit: is there *any* plausible concept of freedom that is an unqualified good?

For our purposes an unqualified good is something where, ceteris parabus, more of it is better for a person, and less of it is worse. This is a kind of "incremental sufficiency" — increasing freedom will increase well-being. For the moment, I leave the question of the converse, "incremental necessity", aside (does increasing well-being necessarily imply an increase in freedom?). Further, apart for some thoughts at the end, I also leave aside the question of collectives, not least because it is difficult to even state what "more freedom" means for a collective. The project of this essay is to inquire into whether, for an individual, more freedom is better

There are two stark contrasts between the way most people think of freedom compared with the way most people 

Since we are so used to identifying well-being with [[happiness is not a real thing|happiness]], we are prone to thinking of well-being as an internal condition. As for freedom, some theorists advocate for an entirely external notion of freedom (the absence of external obstacles), while others contend that there are internal conditions for freedom also (for instance, the absence of brainwashing). Regardless, freedom has a very important external component. Because, in this worldview, freedom and well-being are such different sorts of things, it seems plausible that they could vary somewhat independently of one another. It doesn't take much thought to come up with some examples:
- A smoker who wants to quit but cannot. Would she not be better off if cigarettes were made inaccessible to her?
- A child who doesn't want to go to school. Is he not better off if his parents force him to go?
- 



2) Even if we accept that both well-being and freedom have internal and external components, freedom intuitively seems like a condition *from which* decisions are made, while well-being looks more like a condition *to which* we aim. That is, freedom is a means to the end of well-being. How, then, could well-being consist (even partially), in freedom?


Our intuitive identification of happiness with well-being makes well-being appear to seem a primarily internal state, while freedom (depending )

Now let us suppose that we had some candidate measure for the well-being. Pick your favorite: subje


In my writing I've made a few observations which seem related. 
1. In comparing "happiness" across history, it may well be that people's subjective happiness in the year 1200 was the same as it is now. Would it be right, then, to say they had the same level of well-being? I think not, and here is why: if we were to ask people in the year 1200 if would swap out their level of technology, their systems of government, etc., for the conditions and accoutrements of the present day, would they take the offer? Some may say no, but it is conceivable that many would say yes. Similarly we could ask people in the present day if they would live under thirteenth-century conditions. Of course, some "endowment effect" is to be expected — people will have a natural bias towards what they already have. But if there is a net flow towards the present day, then there would be grounds to say that we are, in fact, better off. 
2. We cannot always make choices on the right timescale. If a smoker wants to quit, and there was a way she could decide, with finality, *I will never smoke a cigarette again*, she might jump at the opportunity. But the decision she makes when she's at the counter of the convenience store is not whether she will ever smoke again, but rather, whether she will buy a pack today. By buying a pack, she doesn't give up the possibility of the massive benefits she could get from quitting (she could quit tomorrow and experience essentially the same benefit), with the added perk that she can smoke today. On the other hand, if she decides not to smoke today, she may easily just cave tomorrow and not experience any of the benefit of quitting, with the added discomfort of a smokeless day today. If there were a way to make a decision not to smoke in a way that she is committed to it, the problem would be resolved — in making that commitment, she would also be assured of the massive benefits she could gain from quitting. 
3. One can think of this last "trick" as making a contract with your future self. But regular-old contract-making is also helpful in decision-making. Think of the case of roommates cleaning their shared living room. Sometimes it happens that no one does it, . This is a public goods game. But if all the roommates agree that they will all do it — a contract — th

It is therefore tempting to view the relationship as one in which freedom is instrumental in achieving well-being, that it is a means to the end of well-being. I believe this is misguided perspective, however. The intuition that well-being is a final state to be achieved through a process apart from it is likely illusory. Home is a place you arrive at in the evening. Is happiness similarly something you arrive at, something that is *maintained* through a process that is different from the process by which it is *attained* (in the case of arriving home, you get there through motion and you stay there through stillness)? Or is happiness itself a dynamic process, that is both increased and sustained through the similar modes of existence? [[happiness is not a real thing|As I argue elsewhere, I am partial to the second perspective]] (in cliche form: it is the journey that matters, not the destination). For this reason, the relation I am hoping to establish between well-being and freedom is one of *constitution* — that well-being consists in a certain type of freedom. 





The correspondence between (2) and (3) is fairly clear: somehow the commitment-making mechanism adds an affordance to the choice-making

But the question then is, what affordances are the right ones? Is more information better? Clearly at some point there will be information overload. Even if not this, sometimes knowing more can create regret. And what sorts of contract-making should be present?

Is this just Rawls's veil of ignorance idea? 

What's stopping us from moving to meta-meta-freedom, and so on, ad infinitum?

How to extend this to collectives?



There are, of course 

The common thread here is that something about the choice is idealized. In the first case, we expand the set of information available to the choice-makers . In the second case we select the "ideal" time horizon. And in the third case we allow for 

This suggests a pathway for uniting the idea of freedom with well-being: if we can come up with a certain idealization of freedom, under which we could say that freedom implies well being, then while we may not actually be able to realize that ideal version of freedom, we could at least move in that direction.
