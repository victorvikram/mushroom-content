Maybe I am old fashioned when I say that universities should be for learning. 

I think it is helpful to start by thinking about what niche universities occupy in the present social fabric. What are they for? 

I should first distinguish between *evolutionary purpose* and a *ethical purpose*. Evolutionary purpose is grounded in what helps something persist and reproduce itself, and ethical purpose is grounded in some idea of what is "good". For instance, we can say that opposable thumbs are "for" grasping because grasping helps us get the things we want, and is therefore good. Therefore, grasping is their ethical purpose. Or one can say that opposable thumbs have reproduced themselves because individuals with opposable thumbs have been better able to hold things, conferring them fitness advantages and making them more reproductively successful. Therefore, grasping is their evolutionary purpose. In the case of thumbs, these two purposes may be aligned, but they need not be. Perhaps our hair's evolutionary purpose was to keep us warm, but at for many, one of its ethical purposes is to make us look good.

So let us ask first, what is the university's evolutionary purpose? What niche have they begun to occupy in the present social fabric that has enabled them to reproduce themselves? For this we need to look for what is enabling universities to continue existing. The easiest place to look is 
1. Tuition dollars — why do students pay to go to school? Certainly at least partially to gain knowledge. But also, to enhance their career prospects by having their capabilities certified by a (hopefully prestigious) institution. 
2. Alumni donations — why do alumni donate to their alma mater? Largely, I would guess, because they identify with it. Princeton alumni feel that they are are part of the Princeton community, and they want to do what they can to make that community successful. Partially for altruistic reasons, and and partially because raising the status of community that one is part of raises one's own status.
3. Government funding — 
5. Nonprofit research grants
6. Corporate contracts
7. Auxiliary operations

Some might criticize the preceding analysis for being overly focused on money. Doesn't the modern university deal in currency besides that? Among these are prestige, influence, community, and knowledge. 

- do a part about what sorts of "moves" universities can make
	- people (students & faculty)
	- research
	- teaching
	- initiatives
	- departments
	- infrastructure

what kinds of things should we expect them to do?

I delineated above how the American university is an engine for generating prestige, influence, community, knowledge, and money. It does this by taking each of these raw materials 

Now let us move on to the ethical purpose of an educational institution. This question is not so simple either. 

- Go on to argue that educational institutions should be "for" advancing collective knowledge — not as the sum total of all knowledge, but rather, as perhaps the collective creative potential unlocked. 
- show that it is completely possible to do this. lay out a concrete proposal for how education could look. mostly self-guided, 50% teaching, questions bubbling up, maybe some predefined learning paths. on the research side of things, focused on integrating knowledge (not just novelty)
- Then say that the current reproductive niche is ill suited to make that happen 
- argue why. education systems are incentivized to be the "unique knowers" of things, they want to set up tribal communities, they want to create distributions rather than elevate everyone, etc. 

tidbits
- argument about grades. best students at harvard want differentiation from worst students at harvard, and harvard cares more about what the best students have to say. that being said, harvard still wants its students to look better than students from other schools.
